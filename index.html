        <p>
          Hi there! I'm a game developer interested in creating compelling interactive story experiences. I've been working with the Unity game engine since my Freshman year,
          experimenting with brief arcade experiences. Head to the Games section to check them out!

        <p>
            I'm currently studying at the University of Michigan, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in 
            Information Science with a concentration in User Experience, and minoring in Computer Science. I'm graduating in December 2018.

            When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, gaming, or writing for <a href="https://everythreeweekly.com">my school's satire newspaper.</a>
